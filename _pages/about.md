I am a fifth and final year [Computer Science](https://cis.upenn.edu) PhD student at the [University of Pennsylvania](www.upenn.edu).
I am a member of [GRASP](grasp.upenn.edu) and my advisor is [Kostas Daniilidis](www.cis.upenn.edu/~kostas).

I work on 3D Computer Vision and more specifically on **model-based** 3D human reconstruction.
My research has focused on exploiting parametric body models and all available data to push the limits of reconstruction.

Before that I studied Electrical and Computer Engineering at [NTUA](https://www.ece.ntua.gr/en), where I worked with [Petros Maragos](http://cvsp.cs.ntua.gr/maragos/).

In the first half of 2020 I was very fortunate to be a visiting PhD student at [Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems](https://is.tuebingen.mpg.de/) advised by [Michael J. Black](https://ps.is.tuebingen.mpg.de/person/black).

Currently I am a Research Intern at [Facebook Reality Labs](https://tech.fb.com/ar-vr/) working with [Minh Vo](https://minhpvo.github.io/).

I am originally from Greece, where I spent most of 2020 and 2021 because of the pandemic. My name in Greek is Νίκος Κολοτούρος.
